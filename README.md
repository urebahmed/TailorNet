## Requirements
python3  
pytorch  
scipy  
[chumpy](https://github.com/mattloper/chumpy)  
[psbody.mesh](https://github.com/MPI-IS/mesh)

Code works with psbody.mesh v0.4 , pytorch >= v1.0 , chumpy v0.7 and scipy v1.3 .

## How to Run
- Download and prepare SMPL model and TailorNet data from [dataset repository](https://github.com/zycliao/TailorNet_dataset).
- Set DATA_DIR and SMPL paths in `global_var.py` file accordingly.
- Download trained model weights in a directory and set its path to MODEL_WEIGHTS_PATH variable in `global_var.py`.

  - [shirt_male_weights](https://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/tailornet/shirt_male_weights.zip)
        (2.5 GB)
  - [This](https://nextcloud.mpi-klsb.mpg.de/index.php/s/LTWJPcRt7gsgoss) link has all the weights listed above as well as the following:
    - pant_female_weights
    - pant_male_weights
    - short-pant_female_weights
    - short-pant_male_weights
    - skirt_female_weights
- Set output path in `run_tailornet.py` and run it to predict garments on some random inputs. You can play with 
  different inputs. You can also run inference on motion sequence data.
- To visualize predicted garment using blender, run `python run_tailornet.py render`. (Blender 2.79 needs to be installed.)

|        skirt  | female |  7.7 |  7.8 |

## Training TailorNet yourself
- Set global variables in `global_var.py`, especially LOG_DIR where training logs will be stored.
- Set config variables like gender and garment class in `trainer/base_trainer.py` (or pass them via command line)
and run `python trainer/base_trainer.py` to train TailorNet MLP baseline.
- Similarly, run `python trainer/lf_trainer.py` to train low frequency predictor and `trainer/ss2g_trainer.py` to
train shape-style-to-garment(in canonical pose) model.
- Run `python trainer/hf_trainer.py --shape_style <shape1>_<style1> <shape2>_<style2> ...` to train pivot high 
frequency predictors for pivots `<shape1>_<style1>`, `<shape2>_<style2>`, and so on. See 
`DATA_DIR/<garment_class>_<gender>/pivots.txt` to know available pivots.
- Use `models.tailornet_model.TailorNetModel` with appropriate logdir arguments to do prediction.

#### Inference Time
In the paper, we report inference time to be 1-2 ms per frame(depending upon garment) which is averaged inference time over the batch of 21 samples(20-40 ms per batch). Apologies for the ambiguity. Running each sample separately takes almost same time as batch - around 20 ms per frame for all garments. However, note that TailorNet has 21 independent MLPs, so we believe that faster inference time is possible if MLPs are configured to run in parallel on GPU cores.

### Misc
- See [./models/skirt_model.md](./models/skirt_model.md) for the explanation of skirt garment model.
- Thanks to Bharat for many fruitful discussions and for `smpl_lib` library taken from his MultiGarmentNet 
repo's [lib](https://github.com/bharat-b7/MultiGarmentNetwork/tree/master/lib) folder.
- Thanks to Garvita for helping out during the onerous procedure of data generation.
